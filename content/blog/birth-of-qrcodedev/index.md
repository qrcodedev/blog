description: "From hackathon hurdles to a better QR Code solution!"
---

Last month, I participated in the renowned [EthGlobal Superhack](https://ethglobal.com/events/superhack) event. During this intense coding marathon, I embarked on creating [Maskie](http://www.maskie.xyz). Maskie is a “secret NFT” project, but that’s beside the point of this post. An integral feature of Maskie was the ability to embed QR Codes into sharable cards. These cards, when shared on social media, would give users quick access to essential information. I thought, "Piece of cake, right?" 🍰 Wrong!

I anticipated that integrating this feature would be a breeze, maybe an hour's job at most. But reality had other plans – it consumed an entire day! 😡 This was especially challenging given the time constraints of a hackathon. Throughout this process, I realized two things:

> 1. Free QR code wizards out there? Kinda meh. 🤷‍♂️
> 2. Integrating QR codes in the backend? Way trickier than it sounds. (maybe one-day a separate blog post on this..)

Post-hackathon, with these challenges replaying in my mind, I decided to build [qrcode.dev](https://www.qrcode.dev), a tool that's not just efficient but fun and user-friendly too!

### **Here's the tldr on qrcode.dev:**

- **For the Basics:** It's a fast and free QR code creator, designed for simplicity and efficiency. No sign ups required. 🎩 ✨
- **For the Advanced:** An easy to use API. This allows you to embed and scale QR Codes anywhere in your tech stack. Plus, you'll get the added advantage of tracking performance and analytics. 📊 🚀

The API is set to launch soon! Hop onto the waitlist and be in the know! As qrcode.dev evolves, I'm all ears (and eyes) for your feedback and insights. Slide into my inbox at **[contact@qrcode.dev](mailto:contact@qrcode.dev)**. Let's chat!
